# FFUP
## What is the Free File Utility Program?
The FFUP is a file utility program, that's it, really
## What about Samex?
Samex had a bad design. It was nice, had a lot of utilities but it had a bad design. It was very hard to navigate through the code. Everytime I created a command, I had to add it to the method that decided whether a command was wrong or correct, when I created Samex, I believed in "The more code, the better.", now I believe that "the less code, the better". Writing many lines of code is useless. Why waste your time?
## No installer?
Not yet.
## No updater?
I will implement a version system.
## No soundex?
No.
## How do I make sure I have the latest version?
Visit the repo regularly then clone it.
## Why did you make this?
Because I don't like working on Samex anymore, it's hard.
## web downloading utility?
Patience. This is just 1.0.
## Did you try to copy bash commands?
No, my commands are shittier.
## Website?
No.

Use "commands" for that
